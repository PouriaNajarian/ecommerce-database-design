E-Commerce Database Design
This repository contains a sample database design for a hypothetical e-commerce platform. The design outlines various entities in an e-commerce system and their relationships, providing a foundational structure for building a scalable and efficient e-commerce application.

Overview
The e-commerce database design includes several tables representing different entities such as users, products, orders, and payments. Each table is structured to store specific information related to its entity, and relationships are established between tables to ensure data integrity and ease of access.

# E-Commerce Database Design

This repository contains a sample MySQL database design for a hypothetical e-commerce platform. The design outlines various entities in an e-commerce system and their relationships, providing a foundational structure for building a scalable and efficient e-commerce application.

## Overview

The e-commerce database design includes several tables representing different entities such as users, products, orders, and payments. Each table is structured to store specific information related to its entity, and relationships are established between tables to ensure data integrity and ease of access.

## Tables and Relationships

### Tables:

1. **Users**
   - Stores information about registered users.
   - Fields include UserID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Password, CreatedAt, and UpdatedAt.

2. **Products**
   - Contains details about the products available for purchase.
   - Fields include ProductID, ProductName, Description, Price, StockQuantity, CreatedAt, and UpdatedAt.

3. **Categories**
   - Represents the different product categories.
   - Fields include CategoryID and CategoryName.

4. **ProductCategories**
   - Establishes a many-to-many relationship between Products and Categories.
   - Fields include ProductID and CategoryID.

5. **Orders**
   - Keeps track of user orders.
   - Fields include OrderID, UserID, OrderDate, Status, and TotalAmount.

6. **OrderItems**
   - Details the items included in each order.
   - Fields include OrderItemID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, and SubTotal.

7. **Addresses**
   - Stores the addresses of users.
   - Fields include AddressID, UserID, Street, City, State, PostalCode, and Country.

8. **Payment**
   - Records payment information for each order.
   - Fields include PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, PaymentDate, and Amount.

### Relationships:

- **Users** to **Orders**: One to Many
- **Users** to **Addresses**: One to Many
- **Orders** to **OrderItems**: One to Many
- **Products** to **OrderItems**: One to Many
- **Products** to **ProductCategories**: One to Many
- **Categories** to **ProductCategories**: One to Many
- **Orders** to **Payment**: One to One

## Usage

This sample MySQL database design can be used as a template for developing e-commerce applications. Developers can adapt the structure, add additional tables, fields, and relationships based on specific project requirements.

## Notes

- Passwords should be stored securely, using hashing and salting.
- The design is simplified for illustrative purposes; additional considerations may be needed based on real-world scenarios.

## SQL Scripts

MySQL scripts are provided to create tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. Developers can utilize these scripts to set up the database structure and modify them according to their needs.
