E-Commerce Database Design
This repository contains a sample database design for a hypothetical e-commerce platform. The design outlines various entities in an e-commerce system and their relationships, providing a foundational structure for building a scalable and efficient e-commerce application.

Overview
The e-commerce database design includes several tables representing different entities such as users, products, orders, and payments. Each table is structured to store specific information related to its entity, and relationships are established between tables to ensure data integrity and ease of access.

Tables and Relationships
Tables:
Users

Stores information about registered users.
Fields include UserID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Password, CreatedAt, and UpdatedAt.
Products

Contains details about the products available for purchase.
Fields include ProductID, ProductName, Description, Price, StockQuantity, CreatedAt, and UpdatedAt.
Categories

Represents the different product categories.
Fields include CategoryID and CategoryName.
ProductCategories

Establishes a many-to-many relationship between Products and Categories.
Fields include ProductID and CategoryID.
Orders

Keeps track of user orders.

Payment

Records payment information for each order.
Fields include PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, PaymentDate, and Amount.
Relationships:
Users to Orders: One to Many
Users to Addresses: One to Many
Orders to OrderItems: One to Many
Products to OrderItems: One to Many
Products to ProductCategories: One to Many
Categories to ProductCategories: One to Many
Orders to Payment: One to One
Usage
This sample database design can be used as a template for developing e-commerce applications. Developers can adapt the structure, add additional tables, fields, and relationships based on specific project requirements.

Notes
Passwords should be stored securely, using hashing and salting.
The design is simplified for illustrative purposes; additional considerations may be needed based on real-world scenarios.
